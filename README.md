## General Information
- Motivation: Interested in learning data science challenges faced by large corporations in enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing revenue
- Project seeks to answer questions:
- Does gender influence offer completion by offer type?
- What group of customers complete offers without viewing those respective offers?
- Does customer annual income influence the amount spent per transaction?
- Can the amount spent per transaction be predicted by customer age, gender and annual income?


## Files
- Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb - Jupyter notebook file that houses all code used in analysis
- portfolio.json - json file containing mock Starbucks offers information. Similar to lookup table for offers
- profile.json - json file containing mock customer information (for ethical reasons). Similar to lookup table for offers
- transcript.json - json file serving as an event log for customer transactions or customer interactions with offers

## Technologies Used
- Python3
- JupyterLab - version 2.1.5


## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Numpy


## Features
- Visualizations
- Linear Regression Machine Learning Algorithm


## Setup
Anaconda Distribution


## Project Status
Complete


## Conclusion
The results of the data exploration and machine learning model indicated that Starbucks data scientists have a challenging job! The answer to all 4 questions posed in the general information section were no.
